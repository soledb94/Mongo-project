The main purpose of this project is to determinate **where in the world** our new gaming company should be based.

***

As a summary:

- EEUU, as most of the video games firms are based over there 

- California State as this area is plenty of companies founded after 2010

- The employees had some preferences that I ponderated as following:
	-Airports should be at leas 100 km far away from the office
	For the rest of preferences will ponderations weights within 20 km that is the :
	 -Executives love starbucks -->10/123-->(20-20 * 0.08)--> Radius: 18 km
	 -30% of employees have a child-->26/123-->(20-20 * 0.2)-->Radius: 16 km
	 -They all love going out to party-->87/123-->(20-20 * 0,70)--> Radius: 6 km
