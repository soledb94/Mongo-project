The main purpose of this project is to determinate **where in the world** our new gaming company should be based.

***

As a summary:

- EEUU, as most of the video games firms are based over there 

- California State as this area is plenty of companies founded after 2010

- The employees had some preferences that I ponderated as following:

- Airports should be at leas 100 km far away from the office
	
- The rest of preferences will be ponderated  within 20 km as following:
	 - Executives love starbucks --> Radius: 18 km
	 - 30% of employees have a child-->Radius: 16 km
	 - They all love going out to party--> Radius: 6 km

The result of this research is that the best location for the new office is:

		COORDINATES: [-118.23341,34.041037]
